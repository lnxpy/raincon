Hi Guy's!<br>
Welcome to 🌈 Raincon 🌈!<br>
Coloric Conky for Linux OS!<br>
<br>
USAGE :<br>
Installing Conky<br>
If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution such as any of the Ubuntu family (Ubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu etc), Linux Mint, Bodhi etc then use the following apt-get command:
<br><br>

>$sudo apt-get install conky

<br>
If you are using Fedora or CentOS use the following yum command:
<br><br>

>$sudo yum install conky

<br>
For openSUSE you would use the following zypper command
<br><br>

>$sudo zypper install conky

<br>
For Arch Linux user the following PacMan command
<br><br>

>$sudo pacman -S conky

<br>
In each of the cases above, I have included sudo to elevate your privileges.
<br>
Running Conky<br>
You can run conky straight from the terminal by running the following command:
<br><br>

>$conky

<br>
On its own, it isn't very good and you might find the screen flickers.
To get rid of the flicker run conky in the following way:s
<br><br>

>$conky -b

<br>
To get conky to run as a background process use the following command:
<br><br>

>$conky -b &

<br>

 > Install Conky Manager for Managing your conkies.<br>
 > Download or clone it then cut all document's to a folder as 'Raincon'<br>
 > Then cut or copy the Raincon folder to ~/.conky <-- this directory maybe hidden!<br>
 > run the Conky Manager Software.<br>
 > check the ~/.conky/Raincon/Raincon conky then use it.<br>
